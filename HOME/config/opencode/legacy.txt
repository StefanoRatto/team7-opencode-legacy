-- prompt to create/update patch legacy.patch
Create a patch file "legacy.patch" that brings back the "legacy" status bar, showing the primary agent name (in agent color) on the right. Refer to opencode v1.0.0-10 (not opencode v0.x.x) for reference. Do not create any additional documentation, just the patch file. Please make sure the agent label has the left-pointing triangle and that the agent lable is visible both when the sidebar is visible, as well as when it is not. GO!!
